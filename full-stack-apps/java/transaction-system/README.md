# PV168 Project: Cash Flow Records

The desktop application will allow me to track my personal cash flow. I want to know how much money I receive and spend, when and for what.

The basic functionality requirements:

- I want to insert, update and delete transactions
- I want to insert, update and delete categories and assign them to transactions
- I want to insert, update and delete currencies (e.g., CZK, EUR)
- I want to insert, update and delete transaction templates from which I can create a new transaction
- I want to view transactions based on selected filters
- I want to see statistics about recorded transactions (e.g., my current balance)
- I want to import/export data to/from the application
